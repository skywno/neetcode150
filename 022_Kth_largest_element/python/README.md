### Kth Largest Element in a Stream

Design a class to find the kth largest integer in a stream of values, including duplicates. E.g. the 2nd largest from [1, 2, 3, 3] is 3. The stream is not necessarily sorted.

Implement the following methods:

constructor(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object given an integer k and the stream of integers nums.
int add(int val) Adds the integer val to the stream and returns the kth largest integer in the stream.
